Hi Suleyman,

You also repeated the 1.3E-4 filter efficiency with the J/psi decays on, more or less.

In the original sample consisting of 10M bbbar events the fraction of these without J/pis decays  is 0.47/1.3 = 0.36, so 3.6M events. Of these .41/3.9 = 0.1 (360000) have just one bbbar pair and the other 90% have more than one pair.

Hi Lenny,

Filter Eff without #B requirement = 4.68E-5
Filter Eff with #B = 4 : 3.87E-5
Filter Eff with #B = 2 : 4.1E-6

in all of them Jpsi decays are turned off.

Thanks

we have 216 jpsi decays, and 80 semi leptonic decays, number is taken from 2M events. B's tend to decay jpsi more, for more read BPH-17-085
